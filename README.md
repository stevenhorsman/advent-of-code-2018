# Advent of Code 2018 

My repo for Advent of Code 2018 in nodejs/javascript. I'm using this as an excuse to work on my javascript, so this shouldn't be used as an example of the best way to do it.

Tests inspired by: https://github.com/mariotacke/advent-of-code-2018

Dev code starts as my own, but I will look at other solutions for inspiration of how to do it better after.

## Running Tests

Each day contains its own set of tests. To run them type `npm test`.
